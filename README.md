This project leverages machine learning to predict diseases based on a set of symptoms. The model analyzes features such as difficulty in breathing, blood pressure, fever, cough, and fatigue to identify potential diseases. Various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, were evaluated. The CatBoost Classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy of 87.14%. The project also incorporates data visualization, statistical analysis, feature extraction, and scaling techniques to enhance model performance.
